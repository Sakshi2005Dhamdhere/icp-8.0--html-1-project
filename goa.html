            Panaji is the state's capital, while Vasco da Gama is its largest city. The historic city of Marg√£o
            in Goa
            still exhibits the cultural influence of the Portuguese, who first voyaged to the subcontinent in
            the early
            16th century as merchants, and conquered it soon thereafter, whereupon Goa became an overseas
            territory of
            the Portuguese Empire, part of what was then known as Portuguese India, and remained as such for
            about 456
            years until it was annexed by India in 1961.[11][12] Goa's official language, which is spoken by a
            majority
            of its inhabitants, is Konkani.

    <p><i>Goa is visited by large numbers of international and domestic tourists each year because of its
            white-sand beaches, active nightlife, places of worship, and World Heritage-listed architecture. It
            also has rich flora and fauna because it lies very close to the North Western Ghats rainforests, one
            of the rare biodiversity hotspots of the world.</i></p>
