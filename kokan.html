            The Konkan is a stretch of land by the western coast of India, bound by the river Daman Ganga at Damaon in
            the north, to Anjediva Island next to Karwar town in the south; with the Arabian Sea to the west and the
            Deccan plateau to the east.
            <br>The hinterland east of the coast has numerous river valleys, riverine islands
            and the hilly slopes known as the Western Ghats; that lead up into the tablelands of the Deccan. The region
            has been recognised by name, since at least the time of Strabo in the third century CE.It had a thriving
            mercantile port with Arab tradesmen from the 10th century.
            <br>The best-known islands of Konkan are Ilhas de Goa, the site of the Goa state's capital at Panjim,
            and the Seven Islands of Bombay, on which lies Mumbai, the capital of Maharashtra and the headquarters of
            the Konkan Division.

    <p><i>The ancient Sapta Konkan was a larger geographical area that extended from Gujarat to Kerala and included the
            whole region of coastal Maharashtra and coastal Karnataka.However,this segment overlaps the Konkan and
            Malabar coast continuum; and usually corresponds to the southernmost and northernmost stretches of these
            locales respectively.</i></p>
